# snowy-man
first in the world rgb snow man
This snow man can be a great gift for your friends, or a great decorative object for your home.
It uses an ATtinny 85 microcontroler to control 10 individualy adresable APA102â€“2020 RGB LED . Because thouse 10 leds need an spi interface to can be controlled, the interface need to be bitbanged on the microcontroler.
Also the pcb can be made on https://jlcpcb.com (this is where i ordered them).
Soon i will develop a new version of snowy man what can be controled via WIFI.
